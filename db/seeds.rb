# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

#Job.create(name: "example job", address: "123 Example Ave.", client: "Charles Charleston", notes: "should be green friendly", job_number: 3456)
#add the rest from factories.rb
